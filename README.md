# 🌐 farhanahmed.pro — Personal Portfolio Website

This is the source and deployment summary for my personal portfolio site [https://farhanahmed.pro](https://farhanahmed.pro), showcasing my work, experience, and projects.

The website is built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, hosted securely on **AWS S3 + CloudFront**, and integrated with **Cloudflare DNS** and **email routing**. It's designed for fast performance, low cost, and maximum control.

## 🧭 Deployment Overview

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup

1. **Domain** purchased from Namecheap.
2. **Cloudflare** added as DNS provider (by pointing Namecheap NS records to Cloudflare).
3. **AWS S3 Bucket** created (private) for hosting site content.
4. **CloudFront Distribution** configured:
   - Points to the S3 bucket.
   - Secured with an **Origin Access Identity (OAI)**.
   - Forces HTTPS.
   - Uses an **ACM Certificate** from `us-east-1`.
5. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Cloudflare CNAMEs created for both `@` and `www` → CloudFront domain.
   - Cloudflare SSL/TLS turned off (handled fully by AWS).
6. **Email Routing** via Cloudflare:
   - `hello@farhanahmed.pro` → personal inbox.

## 📌 Lessons Learned

- Cloudflare and AWS can be tricky together — always ensure SSL/TLS is configured properly.
- React + Vite is fast to build and deploy but ensure all routes like `thankyou.html` are manually created if needed.
- CloudFront + S3 is a solid combo for secure and scalable static site hosting.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add CI/CD (possibly with GitHub Actions).
- Enable visitor analytics.
- Setup a basic CMS or headless blog support.
